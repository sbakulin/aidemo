2. Try to remember the translation
3. Click **"Check Translation"** to reveal the answer
4. Swipe right (or click ✓) if you remembered correctly
5. Swipe left (or click ✗) if you didn't remember

### Settings

- Switch between **Greek → Russian** and **Russian → Greek** learning modes
- Your preference is saved automatically

4. Newly added phrases will appear with higher frequency in learning mode
5. View all existing phrases with their statistics

## Smart Algorithm

The app uses an intelligent algorithm to determine which cards to show:

- **New phrases**: Highest priority (score +500)
- **Wrong answers**: Higher frequency based on error rate (up to +300)
- **Time-based**: Cards not shown recently get priority (up to +200)
- **Never correct**: Extra priority for consistently missed cards (+150)
- **Marked as not remembered**: Additional priority (+100)
- **Randomization**: Small random factor for variety (+0-50)

## Database Schema

The app uses the existing `Greek` table with the following structure:

```sql
create table public."Greek" (
  id bigint generated by default as identity not null,
  "Greek" character varying null,
  "Russian" character varying null,
  "Remembered" boolean null,
  "LastShown" date null,
  "LastCorrect" date null,
  "NumberOfWrong" bigint null,
  "NumberOfCorrect" bigint null,
  constraint Greek_pkey primary key (id)
)
```

## Tips for Effective Learning

1. **Be honest with yourself**: If you hesitated or weren't sure, swipe left
2. **Review regularly**: The algorithm works best with consistent daily practice
3. **Start small**: Add a few phrases at a time to build momentum
4. **Switch directions**: Practice both Greek→Russian and Russian→Greek for complete mastery
5. **Check statistics**: Monitor your progress in the Add tab to see which phrases need more work

## Troubleshooting

### App won't load cards
